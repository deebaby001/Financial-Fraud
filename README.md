EDA and the Data Science Process
Data Science is an all encompassing area of science derived from various elements in the study of Science and Technology. When understanding
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) this is a part of the Data Science process. In the most simplistic terms, it involves, exploration of data and the analysis of the data. 
For the purposes of this project, the EDA consists of: Obtainding a viable dataset, Reviewing the dataset, Cleaning the dataset, Analyzing the data for the appropriate model, Fitting the model to the data and a final analysis--- How well did we do? And what are the Next Steps? in the evolution of this project and the overall Data Science process.

Research Goals
> Goal 1: Comparative Analysis of specific variables and how they interrelate and effect one another.
>
Variables
> The Attributes for analysis are: Movie Rank, Genre, Year, Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue and Metascore
> 
> Goal 2: TBD


#1. DATA

The data is being furnished by an authored contributor and researcher,Promptcloud from Kaggle. This dataset represents a 10-year history of movies between the years 2006-2016.
The location being accessed is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data?select=IMDB-Movie-Data.csv
Note: The following if for additional information purposes: Several data sources have made this informaiton possible, they are: IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/  and
The Numbers: https://www.the-numbers.com/

#2. METHOD

The primary objective is the begin with clean data. Then place that data into a predictive model. 
1. Linear Regression Model

#3. CLEANING REPORT
(IN PROGRESS)

The purpose of this is to present the data in the most unencumbered manner psossible. The data has been cleared of duplicate rows, and columns, NAN, Non-NaN, and Blanks.

#4. EDA

(IN PROGRESS)
The EDA Analysis Report will be displayed in the following:
(PROVIDE: Written Analysis of Results)
ALSO... Provide Data Vizualizations (DV)- Per the instructor, DV is not required here.)

#5. MODELING

(IN PROGRESS)

1st: Provide Pre-Processing Report 
2nd: Modeling Report
2nd: Provide the Linearn Regression Model Data Visualization with Written Analysis

#7. FURTHER RESEARCH

In consideration of other prospective areas of research and analysis in consideration of movie data, I think that there is an opportunity to evaluate some of the following areas of interest: Uncover interesting facts about the film making process, Detecting the roles that the movie goer's plays in the film making process, Evaluationg how human nature impacts the movie experience and Evaluating how world events are significant in the script creation and movie development process. 

#8. CREDITS
The data that was accessed for this project is located at the following sites: Target Movie Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data?select=IMDB-Movie-Data.csv Supporting Resource Sites: IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/ and The Numbers.com:https://www.the-numbers.com/ have provided additional reference matterials for the purposes of this project.
"Special Thank You" to staff at The Numbers for assisting with additional analytical data and support for this project.
