# Financial-Fraud
An investigation of financial fraud investigation of a dataset

EDA and the Data Science Process
Data Science is an all encompassing area of science derived from various elements in the study of Science and Technology. When understanding
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) this is a part of the Data Science process. In the most simplistic terms, it involves, exploration of data and the analysis of the data. 
For the purposes of this project, the EDA consists of: Obtainding a viable dataset, Reviewing the dataset, Cleaning the dataset, Analyzing the data for the appropriate model, Fitting the model to the data and a final analysis--- How well did we do? And what are the Next Steps? in the evolution of this project and the overall Data Science process.

#2. METHOD

The primary objective is the begin with clean data. Then place that data into a predictive model. 
1. Naive Beyes ?

#3. CLEANING REPORT
(IN PROGRESS)

The purpose of this is to present the data in the most unencumbered manner psossible. The data has been cleared of duplicate rows, and columns, NAN, Non-NaN, and Blanks.

#4. EDA

(IN PROGRESS)
The EDA Analysis Report will be displayed in the following:
(PROVIDE: Written Analysis of Results)
ALSO... Provide Data Vizualizations (DV)- Per the instructor, DV is not required here.)

#5. MODELING

(IN PROGRESS)

1st: Provide Pre-Processing Report 
2nd: Modeling Report
2nd: Model Data Visualization with Written Analysis

#7. FURTHER RESEARCH

TBD
